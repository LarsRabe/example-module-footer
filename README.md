# EXAMPLE FOOTER MODULE

This example shows how to create a new footer, with a link
to a new page.

It shows how to:

* create and use a `/resources` folder, which contains your non-PHP files.
* create a URL that links to a function (`getPageAction()`) in the module.
* use templates ("views") to create complete pages and page-fragments.
